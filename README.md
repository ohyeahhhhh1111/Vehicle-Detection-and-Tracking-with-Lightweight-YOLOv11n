# Vehicle-Detection-and-Tracking-with-Lightweight-YOLOv11n

Vehicle detection and tracking systems play a key role in modern intelligent
transportation systems (ITS). By accurately tracking vehicle types and driving patterns.
This technology can provide valuable data to help optimize traffic management
strategies and reduce traffic congestion. In recent years, the use of object detection
models combined with object tracking models has gradually become the mainstream of
this technology. The object detection model can detect objects at high speed and
accuracy; the object tracking model can know the movement of objects. Nevertheless,
in the intelligent transportation system, if the vehicle is traveling too fast, it will cause
miscalculation if the detection speed is not fast enough. Furthermore, if the system
needs to be deployed in a resource-constrained environment, the resource usage of the
two models combined is also a major issue. In this study, a lightweight object detection
model RG-YOLOv11n is proposed. The model can detect objects faster and also takes
up less resources due to its lightweight structure. This article introduces the object
detection algorithm RG-YOLOv11n and proposes an experiment to evaluate multiple
mainstream object detection algorithms with the object tracking model Deep SORT to
find a model that can perform object detection with high speed and low resource usage
under a certain accuracy.
